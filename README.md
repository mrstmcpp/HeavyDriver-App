# HeavyDriver Ride Hailing System (Microservices Architecture)

This project is a scalable **ride hailing backend** built with a **microservices architecture**.  
Each microservice has its own repository. This repository serves as a central documentation hub.

## üöÄ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Spring Boot (Java)
- **Frontend:** React, SockJS, Google Maps API
- **Database:** MySQL, Redis
- **Messaging:** Apache Kafka, RetroFit
- **Service Discovery:** Netflix Eureka
- **Authentication:** JWT (HttpOnly)
- **Others:** WebSockets (STOMP), Redis GeoHash, Flyway migrations

## üìå Features
- Engineered and implemented a **Microservices-based ride-booking platform** with modular components like **Authorization, Booking, Location, Client-Socket & Review services** for enhanced scalability.
- Ensured **clean architecture** with layered services and DTOs for maintainability.
- Integrated **Google Maps APIs** for ETA, route optimization, and fare calculation.
- Secured RESTful endpoints using **JWT-based authentication** with HttpOnly cookies for safe session management.
- Real-time driver location tracking using **Redis GeoHash** for efficient nearby-driver searches.
- Implemented **STOMP WebSocket** for live driver tracking and instant booking status updates.
- Integrated **Kafka & Retrofit** for async booking events and decoupled service communication.
- Employed **Flyway** for automated, version-controlled DB migrations in MySQL services.
- Applied **SOLID principles** and **Builder design pattern** for clean, maintainable, and testable code.
- Horizontal scalability with independent microservices.

## ‚ö° Running Locally
Each microservice has its own setup instructions.  
For quick start:
1. Clone the repo you need (`git clone ...`)
2. **Start the Eureka Server first** so that all services can register and discover each other.
3. Run your **Kafka** & **Redis** containers at **9092** & **6379** ports respectively.
4. Run with Spring Boot (`./gradlew bootRun`)
